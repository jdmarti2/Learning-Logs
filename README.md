# Learning-Logs
Created Web App with Django to journal online.

Link to the web app: [Learning Logs](https://jeremy-learning-log.herokuapp.com/).

Using Django I was able to build this online journal system that lets you keep
track of information you've learned about particular topics. I wrote a
specification for this project, and then defined models for the data the app worked
with. I used Django's admin system to enter some initial data and then learned
how to write views and templates so Django can build the pages of my site.

I also built forms so users can add their own topics and entries, and edit
existing entries. I learned how Django guards against common attacks to form-
based pages so I didn't have to spend too much time thinking about securing
my app.

For styling I used Bootstrap library, a collection of tolls for styling web applications
so they look professional on all modern devices. I deployed this project using Heroku.
